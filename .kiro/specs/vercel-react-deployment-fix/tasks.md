# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update Vite configuration for proper React bundling
  - Modify vite.config.ts to ensure React is properly included in production builds
  - Add explicit React plugin configuration with optimized settings
  - Configure build options to prevent React from being externalized
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Standardize Vercel build process
  - Update vercel-build script in package.json to use consistent build approach
  - Ensure proper working directory and build output alignment
  - Add build verification to catch issues early
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Add explicit React imports where needed
  - Review and update React components that rely on automatic JSX runtime
  - Add explicit React imports as fallback for components that need them
  - Ensure consistent import patterns across all React files
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Update Vercel configuration
  - Modify vercel.json to optimize for React application deployment
  - Ensure proper build command and output directory configuration
  - Add environment variables for production optimization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Create build verification script
  - Write script to verify React is included in production bundle
  - Add checks for proper JSX transformation in build output
  - Implement bundle analysis to catch missing dependencies
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive testing
  - Create tests to verify build process works correctly
  - Add integration tests for Vercel deployment process
  - Implement cross-browser compatibility checks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_
