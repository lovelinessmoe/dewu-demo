# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the "React is not defined" error that occurs when deploying a React + Vite application to Vercel. The error typically manifests as `ReferenceError: React is not defined` in the browser console after deployment, even though the application works correctly in development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my React application to deploy successfully to Vercel without runtime errors, so that users can access the application without encountering JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Vercel THEN the React components SHALL render without "React is not defined" errors
2. WHEN users navigate to any route THEN the application SHALL load and display content correctly
3. WHEN the build process runs on Vercel THEN it SHALL complete successfully without dependency resolution issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel build configuration to properly handle React JSX transformation, so that the automatic JSX runtime works correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vite builds the application for production THEN it SHALL properly configure the JSX runtime
2. WHEN the build artifacts are served THEN React components SHALL have access to the React runtime
3. IF the automatic JSX runtime is used THEN the build SHALL include necessary React imports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent behavior between development and production environments, so that issues don't surface only after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the application locally THEN it SHALL behave identically to the deployed version
2. WHEN building locally with production settings THEN it SHALL produce the same artifacts as Vercel
3. IF there are environment-specific configurations THEN they SHALL be properly documented and handled
